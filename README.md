### An Analysis of bikesharing data in NYC

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to analyze Citibike bikesharing data (number of rides, trip durations, bike IDs, etc.) to determine key relationships between the variables.

Please see https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/syed.kazmi3739/viz/NYCCitiBike_16269765070520/NYCStory?publish=yes for the Tableau dashboard.

## Results

- Checkout time: The number of rides based on trip duration peaks at around 5 minutes, and then drops off. In other words, the most common trip is approximately 5 minutes long. 
- Chceckout time by gender: There are more male users than female or unknown gender users, and the most common trips for men is about 5 minutes long.
- Trips by weekday per hour: Saturdays and Sundays have more trips than other days, and the most common hours are 6-8 am and 5-8 pm.
- Trips by Gender (per weekday hour): Men make the most trips regardless of day or hour
- There is no significant difference between the weekday hour trips between the 3 gender categories for customer users, however among subscribers men make more trips throughout the week 
- Top starting locations: The most common starting locations are centered around the lower west side of the city
- Bike utilization: Certain bikes are more used than others (see Bike ID data)

## Summary

There are noticeable differences in usage based on time of day, weekday, and gender. Two additional visualizations could be:

1. Area map of Starting locations by gender
2. Area map of starting locations by user type
